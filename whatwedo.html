<h2>We provide a community support.</h2>
<p>Many households also struggle with broken relationships, loneliness and rejection, the persistent stress that accompanies poverty, and mental health issues. 
We recognise that these challenges can be overwhelming for anyone to bear, but they are often borne alone. 
We listen to and journey with those who go through difficult times, by providing or rallying support for them.</p>

<h2>We distribute financial protection & promote employment.</h2>

to urban low-income families to help them cope with sudden loss of income due to illness, accident or death.<br />
We also work with employment agencies to conduct job interviews in aim to promote employment opportunities within the community.

<h2>We nurture.</h2>
<p>We recognise that every child is full of potential. However, many children living in poverty weather through challenges such as inadequate care, 
poor nutrition and living conditions, and lack of support to access education. As a result, they often lag behind developmentally. <br />
We provide school supplies and sponsorships to help children with their school related expenses and to give them the support they need to learn and grow. 
We work with families to chip away at the issues hindering their development. We run educational programs to impart key life skills and core values to children, 
through cultivating lasting relationships with teachers and mentors.</p>
